# SDCCD Class Checker

This project was created to allow San Diego Community College District students to actively check their classes for the Spring 2025 semester.


## Purpose

This app targets students from the Mesa, Miramar, and City campuses. Its main goal is to display class details like "Open Seats" and "Waitlist Count."
## How To Use It

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the terminal and change the directory to server by typing:
```bash
cd server
```
3. Edit the classes to search by modifying the ```courses``` variable.
4. Run the server by typing the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python server.py
```
5. Open ```localhost``` in your browser and wait a few seconds while the program retrieves class data.
6. [OPTIONAL] Upload the program to a hosting service to access the class checker from any device, anywhere.
## Why I Made This

I built this app to easily monitor my pending classes for the upcoming semester. My registration date was two weeks after first-priority students, so I needed a way to track my classes conveniently. One challenge I faced was learning how to upload and run a program on a hosting service, as I had previously only worked with localhost. I hope this program will be useful to other SDCCD students as well.
## What's Next?

To further develop this project, I aim to implement a user-friendly frontend interface, allowing for user accounts, seamless course additions, and other features to improve navigation and functionality.
